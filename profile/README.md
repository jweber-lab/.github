# Weber Lab @ UW-Madison 🐟🧬🪱
Welcome to the GitHub home of the Weber Lab.

## About the Lab  
Dr. Jesse Weber is a member of the Department of Integrative Biology at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Our lab studies the genetic basis of complex, ecologically relevant traits — especially in host-parasite systems and vertebrate immune/defense evolution.
Our website: [weberlab.integrativebiology.wisc.edu](https://weberlab.integrativebiology.wisc.edu/)

## What We Research
The lab’s research explores the **process of adaptation in animals**.  
Specifically, we ask: *how* and *why* do animals evolve complex traits to manage environmental pressures?

Although each project follows a unique trajectory, we commonly employ the following approaches:

1. **Identify traits that vary in ecologically meaningful ways**

2. **Characterize the locus (or loci) of evolution**
   - Identify the chromosomal regions and lists of genes or mutations involved  
   - Describe molecular and functional differences between alleles  
   - Experimentally manipulate interesting candidate genes in the lab  

3. **Test how alleles affect fitness in the wild**
   - Conduct experiments that manipulate both genetic background and environment  
   - Use comparative approaches to test for correlations between genetic changes and environmental variation across many populations and species  
   - Perform long-term field studies to measure allele frequency fluctuations across generations 

## The jweber-lab GitHub Org  
This org is intended to host our code, data-analysis pipelines, workflows, and lab-wide shared resources to promote ease of access, transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration.
