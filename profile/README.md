# Weber Lab @ UW-Madison 🐟🧬🪱
Welcome to the GitHub home of the Weber Lab.

## About the Lab  
Dr. Jesse Weber is a member of the Department of Integrative Biology at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Our lab studies the genetic basis of complex, ecologically relevant traits — especially in host-parasite systems and vertebrate immune/defense evolution.
Our website: [weberlab.integrativebiology.wisc.edu](https://weberlab.integrativebiology.wisc.edu/)

## What We Research  
- Investigate how vertebrate hosts evolve *resistance* or *tolerance* to parasitic infection and why some defenses are lost rather than strengthened.
- Utilize natural populations (e.g., fish, parasites) and genetic/genomic tools (e.g., QTL, population genomics, transcriptomics) to uncover the mechanistic basis of adaptation.
- Embrace an interdisciplinary approach: combining behavior, immunology, genomics, ecology, and evolution to ask “how” and “why” adaptation happens.

## The jweber-lab GitHub Org  
This org is intended to host our code, data-analysis pipelines, workflows, and lab-wide shared resources to promote ease of access, transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration.
